# Improvement Opportunities

## Reliability
- Add unit tests for scenario execution, UIA interactions, and diagnostics to detect regressions earlier.
- Mock `pyautogui` and `uia_backend` dependencies in tests so CI can run without desktop access.
- Validate scenario JSON schema (e.g., via `jsonschema`) before execution to catch malformed steps.

## Developer Experience
- Adopt a formatter/linter configuration (such as `black` + `ruff`) and document it in a CONTRIBUTING guide.
- Introduce pre-commit hooks to block accidental commits of generated artifacts (`__pycache__`, reports, etc.).
- Provide example scenarios and a quick-start script in the README to shorten onboarding time.

## Observability
- Record diagnostics output (network, system stats, screenshots) in a structured JSON file alongside scenario runs.
- Persist scenario execution logs with timestamps to simplify failure triage.

## Extensibility
- Wrap UIA/image handlers behind interfaces so they can be swapped for other automation backends.
- Expose the scheduler and trend analyzer via a REST API to integrate with other tooling.
- Parameterize knowledge base paths through environment variables to allow multi-project deployments.
